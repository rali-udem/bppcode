## Contained Projects

### GenText
The Natural Language Generation library.

### BPPGen
* Configuration of GenText for recruitment letters.
* Small Flask server, containing a Web Interface and a small web API.
* API access to BPP data.

### BPPGenBuild
This project contains the code that built the resources for BPPGen. This project is much more flaky: it depends on such things as a 
comptatible MongoDB. All resources generated by BPPGenBuild can be found in the appropriate language's `letter_data` folder.

* A Linux system.
* Python 2.7.11
