# BPPCode
This repository contains the code used to generate letters in Philippe Grand'Maison's master's thesis. Not all parts of the packages are intended to be portable.

## Subprojects

### GenText
The Natural Language Generation library.

### BPPGen
* Configuration of GenText for recruitment letters.
* Small Flask server, containing a Web Interface and a small web API.
* API access to BPP data.

### BPPGenBuild
This project contains the code that built the resources for BPPGen. This project is much more flaky: it depends on such things as a 
comptatible MongoDB. All resources generated by BPPGenBuild can be found in the appropriate language's `letter_data` folder.

## HOWTO
### Requirements
* A Linux system.
* Python 2.7.11
* The python-dev package (`apt-get install python-dev`)
* pip

### Install dependencies
To install in user mode, use `pip --user install`. To install in global mode, use `sudo pip install`.

## Warning
The French version does not work. It would require linguistic resources to properly assign gender. Lexicon generation would have to be more complex.
