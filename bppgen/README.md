# BPPGen
This package uses GenText to generate letters for headhunters, as described in Philippe Grand'Maison's masters' thesis. It
is based on GenText. GenText only runs on Linux and requires nodejs.

### GenText

### BPPGenBuild
This project contains the code that built the resources for BPPGen. This project is much more flaky: it depends on such things as a

## Web interface
BPPGen comes equipped with a Web Interface.
